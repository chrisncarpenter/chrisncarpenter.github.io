### Introduction
For me this is **ultimate** comfort food: one of my all time favourite pasta dishes. Elegant, very tasty and simple to prepare. It demands nothing less than the very best ingredients though so use your very best olive oil, pasta that a deity wouldn’t pass on and prepare yourself a real treat

### Method
Bring 5 litres of water to a rolling boil and add a tablespoon of salt. Plunge the Spaghetti and ensure it’s completely submerged: cook until al-dente

With your sauté pan on a medium heat add the olive oil and gently fry the garlic for a 3-4 minutes until soft and very slightly golden brown. Now the chilli flakes and cook gently.
