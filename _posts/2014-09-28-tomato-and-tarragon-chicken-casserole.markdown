## Tomato with tarragon chicken with braised shallots

### Method

Pick a few tarragon leaves and combine with the flour in a mixing bowl, season with salt and pepper and coat the chicken thighs. You could potentially butcher a whole chicken into 8 pieces.

In to your sauté pan on medium heat add a couple glugs of extra virgin olive oil an brown the meat on both sides, 5-6 minutes.

Keep to one side and sauté the pancetta and garlic for a few minutes then add the shallots which have been peeled and topped. Continue cooking until the shallots are nice and brown. Deglaze the pan with a glass of white wine scrapping the bottom for all the residue: the good stuff.

Add the chicken and cover with the chopped tomatoes and chicken stock. Give it a stir and add half the chopped tarragon.

Turn down the heat to low and cover: cook very slowly for at least an hour and a half, two even better. 

Finish by checking the seasoning and with a final flourish stir in the remainder tarragon.
