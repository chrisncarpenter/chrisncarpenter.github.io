# Twice cooked Buffalo wings

## This recipe comes via chefsteps.com but with a few tweaks

### Method

Remove the wing tips and cut into sections. Place 200ml of water in the bottom of a pressure cooker and insert the basket so it sits above the water. Now place the chicken wings in the pressure cooker, seal and bring up to full pressure. Cook for 10-15 minutes. Allow to cool naturally. Remove from cooker and place on a tray and cool for 2hours.

Remove the cartilage (opaque, white) from the ends and locate the outer bone on the middle sections of the wings. Gently twist and pull out.

Finely grind some chilli powder salt and pepper. It needs to be as fine as possible. Mix with cornflour enough to coat the wings in a large bowl.

In the large bowl, place wings and coat with seasoned cornflour.

Heat the sun flour oil in a saucepan, - it should be a third full - until a square of bread browns in 30secs (Check temperature online and use a thermometer for better accuracy. In small batches deep fry the wings for a minute, minute and a half. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and place into a large mixing bowl separated by kitchen paper to soak up excess oil.

Melt the butter in a small sauce pan, whisk in the coriander, cumin followed by the Franks Hot Sauce. Season with the lime juice.

Once all of the wings are cooked, remove the kitchen paper and pour the wings sauce all over, coating liberally.

Serve with celery and sour cream*


* 100ml of sour cream mixed with a minced garlic clove, salt and pepper.
